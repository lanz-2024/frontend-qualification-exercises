- ✅ **Professional UI** - Clean, modern interface with proper accessibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lanz-2024/frontend-qualification-exercises.git
cd frontend-qualification-exercises

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your Bearer token
```

### Environment Setup
1. Generate a Bearer token using the authentication endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://auth.development.opexa.io/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{}"
```

2. Add the token to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

### GraphQL Queries Implemented
1. **Query.members** - Get all members with pagination
2. **Query.membersByName** - Search members by name
3. **Query.membersByEmailAddress** - Search members by email
4. **Query.membersByMobileNumber** - Search members by mobile number

### Key Features

#### Search & Filter

- **Real-time filtering**: Results update as you type
- **Search type selection**: Choose specific field to search in

#### Data Display
- **Comprehensive table**: All required member fields displayed
- **Status indicators**: Color-coded status and verification badges
- **Date formatting**: Human-readable date/time display
- **Responsive design**: Table adapts to different screen sizes

#### Performance
- **GraphQL caching**: Apollo Client caches queries for better performance
- **Cursor-based pagination**: Efficient loading of large datasets
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
- **Error handling**: Graceful error states with user-friendly messages

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design System
- **Modern interface**: Clean, professional design
- **Consistent spacing**: Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Color-coded status**: Visual indicators for member status and verification
- **Hover effects**: Interactive table rows
- **Loading animations**: Smooth loading spinners

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen reader support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color schemes

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
- **React hooks**: useState and useEffect for local state
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL state management and caching
- **Real-time updates**: Automatic re-fetching on search changes

### Error Handling
- **Network errors**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Authentication errors**: Clear messaging for token issues
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators throughout

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code splitting**: Next.js automatic code splitting
- **Image optimization**: Next.js built-in image optimization
- **Bundle analysis**: Optimized bundle size
- **Caching strategy**: Apollo Client intelligent caching

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across:
- **Desktop** (1024px+): Full table layout with all columns
- **Tablet** (768px-1023px): Optimized table with horizontal scroll
- **Mobile** (320px-767px): Stacked layout with essential information

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ Application loads successfully
- ✅ Search functionality works for all field types
- ✅ Pagination loads additional results
- ✅ Error states display properly
- ✅ Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- ✅ Loading states are shown during data fetching

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is ready for deployment on any platform that supports Next.js:
- **Vercel** (recommended)
- **Netlify**
- **AWS Amplify**
- **Docker containers**

## 📝 Notes

### Authentication
The application requires a valid Bearer token from the ScaleForge authentication endpoint. Without this token, the GraphQL queries will fail, but the application will gracefully handle this with appropriate error messages.

### Data Structure
The application handles the complete Member data structure as specified in the requirements:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Member name
- `verificationStatus`: Verification state
- `emailAddress`: Email contact
- `mobileNumber`: Phone contact
- `domain`: Associated domain
- `dateTimeCreated`: Account creation date
- `dateTimeLastActive`: Last activity timestamp
- `status`: Current member status
